By completing the customer application process and purchasing products from this website, an agreement exists between you and Isupply Electrical  once Isupply Electrical  accepts an order. Each accepted order is a separate agreement.

You will promptly notify Isupply Electrical  if there is any change to this information or data. You must take responsibility for the safekeeping of your username and password, as you are liable if an unauthorised person uses your username and password.
Orders

You place an order with Isupply Electrical  by selecting products and pressing the "Commit To Purchase" button on the cart page.

Product Availability

Isupply Electrical  uses its best endeavours to ensure products ordered are available for delivery, and in most cases will notify you where a product is unavailable prior to you completing your order. However you acknowledge that in some cases this is not possible and Isupply Electrical  may need to reject an order you have placed for a product where Isupply Electrical  establishes that it is actually unavailable for delivery. In such cases Isupply Electrical  will refund in full all amounts you paid in respect of such unavailable product. Isupply Electrical  cannot provide rainchecks for products ordered online, and where permitted by law reserves the right to limit the sale of product quantities.
