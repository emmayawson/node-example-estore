**Other Returns **
******************

Isupply will accept product returns and provide you with an exchange 
voucher, refund or repair where:

	The product is faulty or is not of acceptable quality; or
	The product is not fit for its intended purpose; or
	The product does not match the sample or our description; and
	You can present your Isupply register receipt or other adequate
		 proof of purchase.

Isupply may elect to return the product to the manufacturerâ€™s repair 
agent to determine the nature of the problem. Isupply reserves the 
right not to offer an exchange voucher, refund or repair where the 
item fault is a result of misuse or neglect.

Please be aware that data may be lost during the repair process of
electrical and electronic products.

Goods presented for repair may be replaced by refurbished goods of 
the same type rather than being repaired. Refurbished parts may be 
used to repair goods.

Claims for compensation or reasonable expenses incurred in returning
your purchase should be addressed to our Customer Service team at the
address below and need to be accompanied with supporting evidence.

Our goods come with guarantees that cannot be excluded under the
Australian Consumer Law. You are entitled to a replacement or refund 
for a major failure and for compensation for any other reasonably 
foreseeable loss or damage. You are also entitled to have the goods 
repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality 
and the failure does not amount to a major failure.


Isupply reserves the right to

Assess the condition and age of returned goods prior to providing a 
repair, exchange or refund. This may result in a repair, exchange or 
refund being refused.

please note:

Your original Isupply register receipt is the best form of
proof of purchase

The Isupply Returns Policy applies to online purchases. However, 
instead of the store register receipt as your proof of purchase you

Isupply is committed to protecting your privacy. Any personal
